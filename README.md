# 🎮 Artificial Intelligence in Computer Games with Unity – Homeworks

Welcome to my repository for the **Artificial Intelligence in Computer Games** course using **Unity**. This repository contains all my assignments and implementations throughout the course, focusing on different AI techniques and how they can be applied to create smarter, more responsive, and engaging behaviors in computer games.

## 📚 Course Overview

This course explores various Artificial Intelligence techniques commonly used in game development. Through practical assignments using Unity, we implement and analyze different AI strategies including pathfinding, decision-making, behavior trees, finite state machines, and machine learning techniques with Unity ML-Agents.

## ✅ Objectives

- Understand core concepts of AI in games.
- Implement AI models using Unity (C#).
- Apply pathfinding algorithms like A*.
- Design Finite State Machines (FSMs) and Behavior Trees.
- Experiment with Unity ML-Agents for training intelligent agents.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Unity (2022.x or later)
- C#
- Unity ML-Agents Toolkit
- Visual Studio / Rider
- Git & GitHub

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MoussaBane/Artificial-Intelligence-In-Computer-Games-Unity.git

2. Open the desired homework folder in Unity.

3. Play the scene and observe the AI behaviors in action.

   Note: Some homework may require you to install Unity ML-Agents via the Unity Package Manager.
